This code is written and executed in PyCharm Environment.

I am providing the code file in 2 formats for your use:
1. Darekar-PS.py file
2. Darekar-PS.docx file

Execution 1:
1. Open the Darekar-PS.py file directly using PyCharm.
2. Once opened, you will need to import/install following dependencies:-
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import matplotlib.patches as patches
    import random
3. Once dependencies are install, you will be able to run the code directly on your environment.

Execution 2:
1. Open the Darekar-PS.docx file and copy whole code.
2. Open the PyCharm and create a new python file.
3. Paste the copied code in that new file.
4. Import/install following dependencies:-
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import matplotlib.patches as patches
    import random
3. Once dependencies are install, you will be able to run the code directly on your environment.
